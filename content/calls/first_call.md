# First Call for Papers: ICAPS 2026

The organizers of ICAPS-26 invite paper submissions on all aspects of automated planning and scheduling.  Planning and scheduling are to be interpreted broadly, to encompass a variety of decision-making and optimization problems involving action selection and timing.  This includes domain modeling, plan and schedule synthesis, execution and monitoring, failure diagnosis, model repair, and associated learning, representation, and reasoning problems.  ICAPS welcomes work on both deterministic and stochastic sequential decision-making, both with and without full observability, and both with and without factored state representations.  We welcome theoretical work, experimental work, and work on applications.  Work raising novel challenges and perspectives for the field is especially encouraged.
