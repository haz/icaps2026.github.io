# ICAPS 2026 LaunchPad Workshop – Call for Applications

In addition to the Doctoral Consortium, ICAPS 2026 will host the LaunchPad Workshop, a program designed for undergraduate and Master’s students interested in automated planning and scheduling. ICAPS 2026 will be held in Dublin, Ireland, June 27 – July 2, 2026.

The LaunchPad Workshop will give students the opportunity to interact closely with established researchers in the ICAPS community. Its primary goals are to provide a venue where students can:

- Present research ideas and early results and receive feedback in a supportive environment.
- Receive advice on how to get involved in graduate-level research and on early-career decisions.
- Identify potential advisors, graduate programs, and research topics in automated planning and scheduling.
- Build professional networks with senior researchers and peers that may last beyond the conference.

The workshop will be open to all undergraduate and Master’s student attendees of ICAPS 2026. Registering for the LaunchPad Workshop will be part of the conference registration process, and all eligible students are invited to participate.

The LaunchPad Workshop will take place during ICAPS 2026 in Dublin on **June 27, 2026**.

## Workshop Format and Mentoring

The LaunchPad Workshop will include:

- Introductory and career-oriented talks relevant to starting out in research in planning and scheduling.
- Panel or open discussion sessions on topics such as applying to graduate school, choosing research directions, and building a research profile.
- A Mentoring Program, under which each workshop participant will be matched with a mentor (an established researcher) with whom they can interact during the conference and potentially beyond.

The mentoring component is intended to provide:

- One-on-one feedback on research ideas and plans.
- Guidance on how to develop a successful research career in AI planning and scheduling.
- Support in connecting to the broader ICAPS research community.

## Who Can Apply?

The LaunchPad Workshop is aimed at:

- Undergraduate students (BSc or equivalent) interested in exploring research in automated planning and scheduling.
- Master’s students (MSc or equivalent) who are considering a research career or planning to apply for PhD positions in related areas.

No prior publications are required. We welcome applicants with strong motivation and curiosity about research, regardless of their prior research experience.

## Application Procedure for LaunchPad Workshop Participation

To be considered for the LaunchPad Workshop, applicants are asked to submit
 a single PDF file containing the following items (in order)

1. **Personal Statement (up to 2 pages)**  
   A personal statement describing your background and motivation for pursuing a research career in automated planning and scheduling. You may wish to address why you are interested in AI planning and scheduling and your longer-term goals, what you hope to gain from participating in the ICAPS 2026 LaunchPad Workshop, and any previous experience with research projects (in any area), particularly those related to AI or planning, if applicable.

2. **Research Statement (up to 2 pages)**  
   A research statement outlining a problem or project you are interested in working on (for example, as part of a thesis or a future PhD). You may wish to explain why the problem is significant and feasible, describe any preliminary work you may have already done, mention any ICAPS researchers or groups whose work is related to your topic, and cite relevant papers or resources you are aware of.

3. **Curriculum Vitae (CV)**  
   A CV that includes your university, country, and current study program (e.g., “3rd-year BSc in Computer Science”, “1st-year MSc in AI”) and the total duration of the program. You may also list any prior publications, research projects, internships, or other relevant experience, as well as optional references.

4. **Optional Advisor Letter**  
   An optional short letter from a faculty advisor or supervisor stating their support for your application and whether they can help with travel and lodging support, if relevant.

## Review Process

If the number of applications exceeds the available capacity or support, selection for the LaunchPad Workshop will be based on:

- The clarity, originality, and feasibility of the proposed research topic.
- The student’s motivation for engaging in research and in the ICAPS community.
- The student’s stage in their studies and expected graduation date (to ensure LaunchPad is well-timed for their career decisions).
- Diversity of institutions, countries, and research interests, in order to support a broad and inclusive cohort.

Students who require an early decision for visa purposes will be able to contact the LaunchPad organizers after submitting their application.

## Important Dates for the LaunchPad Program

All deadlines will use **UTC-12** as the reference timezone (i.e., the deadline has not passed as long as there is still time anywhere in the world). Final dates will be announced on the ICAPS 2026 “Dates” and LaunchPad pages.

- **Application submission deadline:** March 2, 2026

## Student Support

The ICAPS 2026 organizers and the DC & LaunchPad chairs are exploring options for student support, which may partially cover travel and/or registration costs for some LaunchPad participants. If such funding becomes available, the LaunchPad organizers will contact selected students directly with further details.

When possible, support will be coordinated with other ICAPS student activities (e.g., the Doctoral Consortium and Summer School) so that students attending multiple events can plan travel efficiently.
